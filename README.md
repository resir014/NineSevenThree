# NineSevenThree

NineSevenThree is a simplified, responsive CSS grid framework. It's originally a base framework designed for my future web projects, but I have decided to add some stuffs and release it for public use.

It's still in early stage, so some things might still be missing.

## Features

* Basic UI & typography elements.
* Responsive and variable grid widths including one-fourths, one-thirds and half of the container size.
* Uses [Normalize.css](http://git.io/normalize)
